# Engine JS Framework
Cloud & Mobile application framework

I know what you are thinking... not another framework. Well there is a valid reason, I have taken a look at all the ones out there, react, angular etc and found that we are going backwards. When I start programming some 30 years ago you wrote your code in a text editor and you compiled it, now the practice is to do exactly same, so we have simply come full circle.

Still under development
