# Engine JS Framework
Cloud & Mobile application framework

I know what you are thinking... not another framework. Well there is a valid reason, I have taken a look at all the ones out there, react, angular etc and found that we are going backwards. When I start programming some 30 years ago; you wrote your code in a text editor and you compiled it, now the practice is to do exactly same, so we have simply come full circle. Plus the sheer volume of dependencies that get loaded even before you start to develop is ridiculous.

So I wanted a simple framework that had a small footprint, could be installed from a simple zip file and was ready to go start off.
